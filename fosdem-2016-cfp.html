    <h1>Call For Presentations:<br/>Lua devroom at FOSDEM 2016</h1>

<p><a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> is the Free and Open source Software
Developers' European Meeting, a conference happening every year in
Brussels, Belgium, over a weekend. This year it will be on January
30-31. It is the biggest FOSS event in Europe with over 5000 participants and
400 speakers.</p>

<p>In 2015 we had an impromptu Birds of a Feather meeting for the Lua
community there. In 2016 we will have a real developer room, on the
afternoon of Saturday 30th January, so we are now accepting
submissions of talk proposals.</p>

<p>The format will be 30 minutes talks, including questions (so roughly
20-25 minutes for talks, 5-10 minutes for Q&amp;A). Feel free to ask if
you would like to have a longer or a shorter slot.</p>

<p>The talks will be filmed, possibly streamed live, and the videos will
be made available publicly under a CC-BY license. Submitting a talk
for the devroom implies that you agree to be filmed under such terms.</p>

<p>All topics related to Lua (including LuaJIT) are accepted.
The deadline for submission is
Tuesday 1st December 2015. All submission should be made using
<a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM16">the
FOSDEM even planning tool Pentabarf</a>. When you create your event,
make sure to select "Lua devroom" under "Track". If you already have a
Pentabarf account from a previous year, please reuse it instead of
creating a new one.</p>

<p>In the morning, this room will be used by the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">GNU Guile</a> community.
We are considering sharing one hour around lunch time for talks that
may interest both communities. So if you have an idea for such a talk,
do not hesitate to submit it!</p>

<p>There is a mailing-list for the devroom, to which you can
<a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo/lua-devroom">subscribe</a>
(subscriptions have to be accepted by an admin so you will not
receive the confirmation email immediatly).</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, you can contact the devroom organizers by
email:
